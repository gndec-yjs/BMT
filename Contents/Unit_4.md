## **4.1 Introduction to Quality Control in Construction**

**Definition:**
Quality control (QC) in construction ensures that building materials and workmanship conform to specified standards, ensuring safety, durability, and serviceability of structures.

**Objectives:**

* Maintain uniformity and reliability in construction quality
* Prevent use of defective materials
* Reduce wastage, cost, and rework
* Ensure compliance with IS codes and design specifications

**Key Components of QC:**

1. **Quality Planning** â€“ setting material specifications and procedures
2. **Quality Assurance (QA)** â€“ system of checks and audits
3. **Quality Control (QC)** â€“ actual testing and verification

## **4.2 Sampling of Building Materials**

| **Material** | **Relevant IS Code** | **Sampling Method**                         | **Typical Quantity for Testing**          |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Cement       | IS 3535              | Random sampling from 20 bags or batch       | Minimum 12 kg composite sample            |
| Aggregates   | IS 2430              | Random samples from conveyor or truck loads | 30 kg for coarse, 10 kg for fine          |
| Concrete     | IS 1199, IS 516      | Cube sampling from fresh mix                | 3 specimens per test                      |
| Bricks       | IS 5454              | Random 20 bricks from batch                 | 5 for compression, 5 for water absorption |
| Steel        | IS 1786              | 1 sample per heat/lot                       | 3 specimens for tensile test              |
| Timber       | IS 1734              | From each species or lot                    | Minimum 3 samples for mechanical test     |

**Note:** Samples must be **representative**, **properly labeled**, and **stored to prevent contamination** before testing.

## **4.3 Acceptance Criteria and Tolerances**

Acceptance is based on comparing **test results** with the **minimum required standards** specified in IS codes.

| **Material** | **Acceptance Parameter**                  | **Standard Reference** | **Typical Requirement** |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Cement       | Fineness, soundness, compressive strength | IS 269, IS 4031        | â‰¥ 33 MPa (OPC 33 grade) |
| Aggregates   | Sieve analysis, impact, crushing value    | IS 383                 | â‰¤ 30% impact value      |
| Concrete     | Compressive strength                      | IS 456, IS 10262       | Mean â‰¥ fck + 1.65 s     |
| Bricks       | Compressive strength, water absorption    | IS 1077                | â‰¥ 7.5 MPa, â‰¤ 20%        |
| Steel        | Tensile strength, elongation              | IS 1786                | â‰¥ TMT Fe 500 â†’ 545 MPa  |
| Timber       | Moisture, bending, crushing strength      | IS 287                 | Moisture â‰¤ 12â€“15%       |
