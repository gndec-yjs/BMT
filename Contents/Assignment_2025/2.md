## **Assignment Questions**

| **Q. No.** | **Question**                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **CO**   | **RBT Level** | **Marks** |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1          | Explain the **composition of concrete** in terms of cement compounds (oxides), aggregates, and admixtures. Discuss the role of each constituent in strength and durability.                                                | CO1      | L2            | 5         |
| 2          | Describe the **manufacturing/production process of concrete** including batching, mixing, transportation, placing, compaction, and curing. Highlight modern practices.                                                     | CO1 | L3            | 5         |
| 3          | Explain the concept of **waterâ€“cement ratio**. Discuss its influence on strength, workability, and durability of concrete with reference to Abramâ€™s law.                                                                   | CO1 | L2            | 5         |
| 4          | Draw and explain the **stressâ€“strain curve of concrete** under compression. Compare briefly with that of steel to highlight ductility vs. brittleness.                                                                     | CO2  | L3            | 5         |
| 5          | Differentiate between **characteristic compressive strength $(f_{ck})$** and **target mean strength $(f_{t})$** of concrete. Explain why a margin is considered in mix design.                                                      | CO3 | L2            | 5         |
| 6          | Discuss key **mechanical and durability properties of concrete** (compressive strength, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, permeability, creep, shrinkage).                                                          | CO2, CO3 | L3      | 5         |
| 7          | Explain common **defects in concrete structures** (honeycombing, segregation, bleeding, cracks). Suggest preventive measures and IS code references.                                                                       | CO2, CO6 | L4            | 10        |
| 8          | Case study: For a multi-storey building in Ludhiana, select suitable material for (a) foundation, (b) walls, (c) columns, (d) beams, and (e) roofing. Justify your choice based on strength, durability, and IS standards. | CO2, CO6| L4            | 10        |
| 9          | Prepare a **comparative summary table** of concrete, bricks, stones, timber, and steel showing composition, production, key properties, and applications.                                                                  | CO2, CO6 | L6            | 10        |
