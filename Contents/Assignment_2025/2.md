| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1          | Describe the composition and constituent materials of (a) concrete, (b) bricks, (c) steel, (d) stones, and (e) timber. Include their main roles in structural applications.                                                | CO1      | L2            | 5         |
| 2          | Explain the production/manufacturing processes of concrete, bricks, and steel. Highlight key steps, batching/mixing for concrete, and modern production techniques for steel.                                              | CO1, CO2 | L3            | 5         |
| 3          | Compare **microstructure** and **loadâ€“deformation response** of concrete, steel, bricks, stones, and timber. Include diagrams or placeholders for figures where applicable.                                                | CO1, CO3 | L3            | 5         |
| 4          | Discuss **strength and other properties** (tensile, compressive, ductility, toughness, water absorption, permeability) of the five materials. Include classification of bricks and grades of steel used in RCC.            | CO2, CO3 | L2, L3        | 5         |
| 5          | Explain common **defects** observed in concrete, bricks, steel, stones, and timber and suggest preventive measures.                                                                                                        | CO2, CO5 | L4            | 10        |
| 6          | Case study: For a multi-storey building in Ludhiana, select suitable material for (a) foundation, (b) walls, (c) columns, (d) beams, and (e) roofing. Justify your choice based on strength, durability, and IS standards. | CO2, CO5 | L4            | 10        |
| 7          | Create a **comparative summary table** of the five materials showing composition, production, microstructure, mechanical/physical properties, and applications.                                                            | CO3, CO6 | L6            | 10        |
