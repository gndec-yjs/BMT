# [2.1 Concrete](#21-concrete)

## [2.1.1 Composition and Constituent Materials](#211-composition-and-constituent-materials)

Concrete is a **composite construction material** made primarily from cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, water, and sometimes admixtures. The performance of concrete depends significantly on the properties of each constituent.

### Cement

* **Role:** Acts as the binding material, developing strength through hydration.
* **Properties:**

  * Fineness (affects rate of hydration and strength gain)
  * Setting time (initial & final)
  * Soundness (resistance to volume change)
  * Strength (compressive strength of cement mortar cubes)
    
* **Composition (by oxides):**

| **Oxide Component**        | **Typical % Range in OPC** | **Role / Function**                                                     |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CaO (Lime)**             | 60 – 67 %                  | Provides strength and soundness; excess causes unsoundness              |
| **SiO₂ (Silica)**          | 17 – 25 %                  | Contributes to strength development at later stages (C-S-H formation)   |
| **Al₂O₃ (Alumina)**        | 3 – 8 %                    | Lowers clinkering temperature; influences setting time                  |
| **Fe₂O₃ (Iron oxide)**     | 0.5 – 6 %                  | Imparts color; contributes slightly to strength; acts as flux           |
| **MgO (Magnesia)**         | 0.1 – 4 % (≤ 6% as per IS) | Small amounts improve strength; excess leads to expansion & unsoundness |
| **SO₃ (Sulphur trioxide)** | 1 – 3 % (≤ 3.5% as per IS) | Controls setting time; regulates expansion                              |
| **Na₂O + K₂O (Alkalis)**   | 0.2 – 1 %                  | Can cause efflorescence & alkali-aggregate reaction if high             |

* **Main compounds (Bogue’s):**

  * C₃S (early strength)
  * C₂S (later strength)
  * C₃A (initial setting, heat generation)
  * C₄AF (reduces clinkering temperature)

### Fine Aggregates (Sand)

* **Role:** Fills voids between coarse aggregates, improves workability.
* **Properties:**

  * Grading (as per IS sieve analysis)
  * Fineness modulus
  * Cleanliness (free from silt/clay)
  * Specific gravity & water absorption

### Coarse Aggregates

* **Role:** Provide bulk, strength, and dimensional stability.
* **Properties:**

  * Size & shape (angular preferred for strength)
  * Crushing value & impact value (measure resistance to failure)
  * Water absorption
  * Grading for proper packing

### Water

* **Role:** Hydration of cement + workability of mix.
* **Requirement:** Must be free from salts, acids, organic matter.

### Admixtures

* **Role:** Modify properties of concrete for specific needs.
* **Types:**

  * Plasticizers & Superplasticizers – improve workability
  * Accelerators – reduce setting time
  * Retarders – increase setting time
  * Air-entraining agents – improve frost resistance
  * Mineral admixtures – fly ash, silica fume, slag (improve durability & reduce heat of hydration)

## [2.1.2 Production of Concrete](#212-production-of-concrete)

Concrete production involves several stages to ensure uniformity, strength, and durability.

### Batching (Measuring Quantities of Ingredients)

* **Weight Batching (preferred):** Ingredients measured by mass → accurate & consistent.
* **Volume Batching:** Ingredients measured by volume → less accurate, prone to errors.

#### Weight vs. Volume Batching

| Feature           | Weight Batching              | Volume Batching                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Accuracy          | High                         | Low                                 |
| IS Code Reference | Recommended                  | Not recommended for important works |
| Cost              | Higher (needs weigh batcher) | Lower                               |
| Consistency       | Excellent                    | Variable                            |
| Usage             | Major projects               | Small, unimportant works            |

### Mixing (Uniform Blending of Materials)

* **Hand Mixing:** For small works, not very uniform.
* **Machine Mixing:** Using drum or pan mixers, ensures uniformity.

### Transporting and Placing

* **Transport Methods:** Wheelbarrows, transit mixers, pumps.
* **Key Requirement:** Prevent segregation and loss of water.

### Compaction

* **Hand Ramming / Rodding** (small works)
* **Vibration** (internal/needle, surface, formwork vibrators)

### Curing

* Ensures hydration continues to achieve strength & durability.
* **Methods:** Water curing, wet coverings, membrane curing, steam curing.
* **Duration:** Minimum 7–14 days depending on cement type.

### Segregation vs. Bleeding

| Aspect     | Segregation                                 | Bleeding                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Separation of coarse aggregates from mortar | Water rising to surface          |
| Cause      | Excess water, improper handling, vibration  | High water content, poor grading |
| Effect     | Non-uniform concrete, honeycombing          | Weak surface layer, cracks       |
| Prevention | Proper mix design, controlled vibration     | Use of fines, proper w/c ratio   |

## [2.1.3 Microstructure of Concrete](#213-microstructure-of-concrete)

* The microstructure consists of **hydrated cement paste (C–S–H gel, CH crystals), unhydrated cement particles, aggregates, and pores.**
* Strength and durability depend on porosity, interfacial transition zone (ITZ), and bond between aggregates and paste.

* The microstructure of hydrated concrete consists primarily of **calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) gel**, a complex, fibrous, or gel-like material formed from the reaction of cement and water, and calcium hydroxide (CH) crystals, which are thin, hexagonal plates. These hydration products, along with remaining unhydrated cement particles and a network of pores, interlock to create a rigid, hardened matrix that binds aggregates together. The overall microstructure is a heterogeneous composite of these phases, the exact nature of which significantly influences the mechanical properties and durability of the concrete.

_Fig: Microstructure of Hydrated Concrete_

### **_Key Components of the Hydrated Microstructure_**

- **C–S–H gel:** This is the main binding phase in concrete and is formed from the hydration of calcium silicates (alite and belite) in Portland cement. C–S–H is a poorly crystalline material with a high surface area and variable composition, providing much of the concrete's strength.
  
- **Calcium Hydroxide (CH):** Also known as portlandite, this is a product of cement hydration and appears as larger, dense hexagonal crystals. While it contributes to the mass of the hardened paste, it is often considered a less significant factor in strength than C–S–H and can be susceptible to acid attack.
  
- **Unhydrated Cement Particles:**
Even after hardening, some cement particles remain unreacted. These are residual components within the microstructure that continue to hydrate and contribute to strength over time.

- **Pores:**  
The microstructure contains various pores, including the gel pores within the C–S–H gel and larger capillary pores. The distribution and size of these pores affect the concrete's permeability and overall durability.

- **Aggregates:**
Concrete also contains large aggregates (sand and gravel) that are encapsulated by the hydrated cement paste. These are not part of the cement paste microstructure itself but are essential components of the composite material. 

### **_Formation and Properties_**

1. **Hydration:** When water is added to Portland cement, the cement compounds begin a series of chemical reactions. 
2. **Product Formation:** The reactions produce C–S–H gel, calcium hydroxide crystals, and other hydration products. 
3. **Microstructure Development:** These products grow and interlock, filling the space and solidifying into a rigid, hardened mass that binds the aggregates. 
4. **Variability:** The exact microstructure, including the ratio of C–S–H to CH and the pore network, is influenced by the cement's composition, the water-to-cement ratio, and curing conditions.

### **_Significance_**
The microstructure of hydrated concrete dictates its properties. A well-developed microstructure, with a dense C–S–H network and well-distributed pores, leads to high strength and low permeability, which is crucial for the durability and performance of concrete structures.

| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Definition   | Strength obtained from cube/cylinder test | Strength required to ensure desired characteristic strength |
| Based on     | Actual test results                       | Statistical consideration                                   |
| IS Reference | Cube test (150 mm cube)                   | Mix design (IS 10262)                                       |
