# [2.1 Concrete](#21-concrete)

## [2.1.1 Composition and Constituent Materials](#211-composition-and-constituent-materials)

Concrete is a **composite construction material** made primarily from cement, fine aggregates, coarse aggregates, water, and sometimes admixtures. The performance of concrete depends significantly on the properties of each constituent.

### Cement

* **Role:** Acts as the binding material, developing strength through hydration.
* **Properties:**

  * Fineness (affects rate of hydration and strength gain)
  * Setting time (initial & final)
  * Soundness (resistance to volume change)
  * Strength (compressive strength of cement mortar cubes)
* **Composition (by oxides):**

  * CaO (lime): Strength, soundness
  * SiO₂ (silica): Strength development at later stages
  * Al₂O₃ (alumina): Reduces clinkering temperature, controls setting
  * Fe₂O₃ (iron oxide): Color, contributes to strength
  * MgO, SO₃: In small quantities, regulate properties
* **Main compounds (Bogue’s):**

  * C₃S (early strength)
  * C₂S (later strength)
  * C₃A (initial setting, heat generation)
  * C₄AF (reduces clinkering temperature)

### Fine Aggregates (Sand)

* **Role:** Fills voids between coarse aggregates, improves workability.
* **Properties:**

  * Grading (as per IS sieve analysis)
  * Fineness modulus
  * Cleanliness (free from silt/clay)
  * Specific gravity & water absorption

### Coarse Aggregates

* **Role:** Provide bulk, strength, and dimensional stability.
* **Properties:**

  * Size & shape (angular preferred for strength)
  * Crushing value & impact value (measure resistance to failure)
  * Water absorption
  * Grading for proper packing

### Water

* **Role:** Hydration of cement + workability of mix.
* **Requirement:** Must be free from salts, acids, organic matter.

### Admixtures

* **Role:** Modify properties of concrete for specific needs.
* **Types:**

  * Plasticizers & Superplasticizers – improve workability
  * Accelerators – reduce setting time
  * Retarders – increase setting time
  * Air-entraining agents – improve frost resistance
  * Mineral admixtures – fly ash, silica fume, slag (improve durability & reduce heat of hydration)

## [2.1.2 Production and Batching Methods](#212-production-and-batching-methods)

Concrete production involves several stages to ensure uniformity, strength, and durability.

### Batching (Measuring Quantities of Ingredients)

* **Weight Batching (preferred):** Ingredients measured by mass → accurate & consistent.
* **Volume Batching:** Ingredients measured by volume → less accurate, prone to errors.

#### Weight vs. Volume Batching (Tabular Difference)

| Feature           | Weight Batching              | Volume Batching                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Accuracy          | High                         | Low                                 |
| IS Code Reference | Recommended                  | Not recommended for important works |
| Cost              | Higher (needs weigh batcher) | Lower                               |
| Consistency       | Excellent                    | Variable                            |
| Usage             | Major projects               | Small, unimportant works            |

### Mixing (Uniform Blending of Materials)

* **Hand Mixing:** For small works, not very uniform.
* **Machine Mixing:** Using drum or pan mixers, ensures uniformity.

### Transporting and Placing

* **Transport Methods:** Wheelbarrows, transit mixers, pumps.
* **Key Requirement:** Prevent segregation and loss of water.

### Compaction

* **Hand Ramming / Rodding** (small works)
* **Vibration** (internal/needle, surface, formwork vibrators)

### Curing

* Ensures hydration continues to achieve strength & durability.
* **Methods:** Water curing, wet coverings, membrane curing, steam curing.
* **Duration:** Minimum 7–14 days depending on cement type.

### Segregation vs. Bleeding (Tabular Difference)

| Aspect     | Segregation                                 | Bleeding                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Definition | Separation of coarse aggregates from mortar | Water rising to surface          |
| Cause      | Excess water, improper handling, vibration  | High water content, poor grading |
| Effect     | Non-uniform concrete, honeycombing          | Weak surface layer, cracks       |
| Prevention | Proper mix design, controlled vibration     | Use of fines, proper w/c ratio   |
