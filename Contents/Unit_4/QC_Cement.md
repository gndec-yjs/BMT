# **4.4 QUALITY CONTROL OF CEMENT**

### **4.4.1 Introduction**

Cement is the most essential binding material in construction. Its quality directly affects the strength, durability, and overall performance of concrete and mortar. Hence, strict quality control during manufacture, storage, transportation, and field application is vital to ensure reliable construction outcomes.

### **4.4.2 Objectives of Quality Control**

* Ensure conformity to specified **chemical and physical properties**.
* Maintain **consistency** in quality between different batches.
* Prevent the use of **deteriorated or adulterated** cement.
* Establish **standardized procedures** for sampling, testing, and acceptance.

### **4.4.4 Stages of Quality Control**

#### **a) At the Manufacturing Plant**

* Continuous control of **raw mix proportioning** and **kiln burning conditions**.
* Monitoring **clinker composition**, free lime, and gypsum content.
* Routine testing of **fineness, setting time, and compressive strength**.
* Proper **silo storage** to prevent moisture ingress.

#### **b) During Storage and Handling**

* Store in a **dry, ventilated, elevated** godown.
* Keep bags on **wooden pallets** and away from walls.
* Follow **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** policy.
* Inspect for **lumps** and **discoloration** before use.

#### **c) At Construction Site**

* Perform **field identification tests** before use.
* Collect **samples for laboratory testing** at regular intervals as per IS 3535.
