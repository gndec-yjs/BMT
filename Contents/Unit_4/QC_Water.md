# **4.7 QUALITY CONTROL OF WATER FOR CONCRETE MIXING**

Water used for concrete must be clean and free from harmful quantities of oils, acids, alkalis, salts, organic matter, or other impurities that may adversely affect the properties of concrete or steel reinforcement. Ensuring the quality of mixing and curing water is therefore a crucial part of concrete quality control.

## **4.7.1 Sources of Water**

| **Source Type**                    | **Typical Characteristics**                               | **Precautions / Remarks**                               |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Potable water (drinking water)** | Usually safe and suitable for mixing and curing concrete  | No further testing generally required                   |
| **Groundwater (wells, boreholes)** | May contain dissolved salts or minerals                   | Must be tested for chlorides, sulphates, and alkalinity |
| **Surface water (rivers, ponds)**  | May contain organic matter, silt, or suspended impurities | Filtration or sedimentation required before use         |
| **Recycled / treated water**       | Water recovered from concrete batching plants             | Acceptable if it meets IS 456 and IS 3025 limits        |

## **4.7.2 Requirements as per IS 456**

Water shall be **free from deleterious materials** in amounts that could cause:

* Reduction in **strength** of concrete,
* **Corrosion** of reinforcement,
* **Efflorescence** or surface discoloration, and
* **Unacceptable volume stability**.

The general rule is:

> **“Water fit for drinking is fit for concrete.”**
