# **4.8 QUALITY CONTROL OF CONCRETE (FRESH AND HARDENED)**

Quality control of concrete ensures that the produced mix meets the desired performance criteria in terms of **strength, workability, durability, and uniformity**. The process includes **control of constituent materials**, **mix proportioning**, **production**, **placement**, and **testing of fresh and hardened concrete** as per relevant Indian Standards.

## **4.8.1 Objectives of Concrete Quality Control**

* To ensure **uniform and consistent quality** of concrete at all stages.
* To maintain **strength and durability** as per design specifications.
* To detect deviations in **mix proportions or workmanship**.
* To ensure compliance with **BIS codes and contract specifications**.
* To reduce material wastage and achieve **economical concrete production**.
