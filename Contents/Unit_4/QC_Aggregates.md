# **4.5 QUALITY CONTROL OF AGGREGATES (FINE AND COARSE)**

Aggregates form about 60–75 % of the total volume of concrete; their quality directly affects the workability, strength, and durability of concrete and mortar. Quality control ensures uniformity, compliance with standards, and durability of the finished structure.

## **4.5.1 Objectives of Quality Control for Aggregates**

* To verify compliance with grading, strength, and cleanliness specifications.
* To minimize variations in aggregate properties between different sources and batches.
* To ensure aggregate performance under expected service and environmental conditions.
* To control deleterious materials (clay, silt, organic impurities).
