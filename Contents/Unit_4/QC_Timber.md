# **4.11 QUALITY CONTROL OF TIMBER**

Timber is widely used in **construction for formwork, doors, windows, roofing, furniture, and structural elements**. Quality control ensures **strength, durability, resistance to pests, and dimensional stability**.

## **4.11.1 Objectives of Timber Quality Control**

* Ensure timber meets **mechanical strength and durability requirements**.
* Detect **defects such as knots, splits, warping, and decay**.

## **4.11.4 Field Quality Control Measures**

* **Proper Storage:** Keep timber raised from ground, covered, and well-ventilated to prevent moisture absorption.
* **Handling:** Avoid dropping or dragging timber to prevent surface damage and internal cracks.
* **Seasoning:** Ensure timber is air-seasoned or kiln-dried to the required moisture content before use.
* **Preservative Treatment:** Check treated timber for uniform penetration and retention of chemicals.
* **Inspection:** Examine for visible defects such as warping, splitting, and termite attack before installation.
