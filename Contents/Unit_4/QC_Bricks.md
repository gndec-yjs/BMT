# **4.9 QUALITY CONTROL OF BRICKS**

Bricks are widely used **masonry units** in construction. Quality control ensures that bricks meet **strength, durability, dimensional accuracy, and durability standards**, providing safe and long-lasting masonry structures.

## **4.9.1 Objectives of Brick Quality Control**

* Ensure uniform **size, shape, and surface finish**.
* Achieve **adequate compressive strength** for load-bearing walls.
* Minimize **water absorption** to prevent dampness and efflorescence.
* Detect **defective or under-burnt bricks**.
* Ensure compliance with **BIS standards**.

## **4.9.2 Types of Bricks**

| **Type**               | **Description / Use**                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clay Bricks**        | Red or burnt clay bricks used in walls and partitions.                    |
| **Fly Ash Bricks**     | Made of fly ash, lime, and gypsum; lightweight and durable.               |
| **Concrete Bricks**    | Made of cement and aggregates; used for non-load-bearing walls.           |
| **Engineering Bricks** | High-strength, low-porosity bricks for retaining walls and damp-proofing. |

## **4.9.3 Laboratory Quality Tests for Bricks**

| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **1**      | **Compressive Strength Test**           | Determines the load-bearing capacity of brick                   | ≥ 3.5 MPa (common), ≥ 10 MPa (engineering bricks)   | IS 3495 Part 1         |
| **2**      | **Water Absorption Test**               | Measures porosity and durability against moisture               | ≤ 20% by mass (clay bricks), ≤ 15% (fly ash bricks) | IS 3495 Part 2         |
| **3**      | **Efflorescence Test**                  | Detects presence of soluble salts that can cause white deposits | Nil to slight (Grade 1)                             | IS 3495 Part 3         |
| **4**      | **Dimension and Tolerance Check**       | Ensures standard size and uniformity for easy masonry work      | Tolerance ±3 mm in length/width, ±2 mm in height    | IS 1077                |
| **5**      | **Hardness / Soundness Test**           | Strike brick lightly; should produce a clear ringing sound      | Clear ringing indicates good quality                | IS 1077                |
| **6**      | **Shape and Surface Defect Inspection** | Checks for cracks, warping, under-burning                       | Bricks should be rectangular, well-burnt, uniform   | IS 1077                |
| **7**      | **Impact / Drop Test**                  | Checks resistance to handling and transportation                | Should not break when dropped from 1 m height       | IS 1077                |

## **4.9.4 Field Quality Control Measures**

* Reject **under-burnt or defective bricks** before masonry work.
* **Store bricks on raised platforms** to avoid contact with soil moisture.
* Ensure **uniform soaking of clay bricks** before laying (for water absorption control).
* Maintain proper **mortar-to-brick bond** for masonry strength.
* Monitor **daily compliance** with size, shape, and strength requirements.
