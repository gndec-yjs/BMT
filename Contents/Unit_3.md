## 3.4 Carbon Composites

**Definition:** High-strength, lightweight materials made of carbon fibers embedded in resin.

**Types:**

* Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets, laminates, fabrics

**Uses:**

* Retrofitting beams, columns, slabs
* Strengthening structural elements

**Selection Criteria:**

* Load requirements
* Environmental exposure
* Cost-effectiveness

**Methods of Application:**

* Bonding with epoxy resin

* Exposure conditions (sun, water, chemicals)
* Durability and maintenance
* Cost, availability, and workability
* Environmental impact

## 3.7 Methods of Application

| Material                | Application Method                  | Notes                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Paints & Varnishes      | Brush, roller, spray                | Clean and prime surface before application |
| Bitumen & Asphalt       | Spraying, spreading, heating        | Ensure proper compaction                   |
| Waterproofing Membranes | Brush, trowel, spray, sheet overlap | Overlap and seal joints carefully          |
| Geotextiles             | Laying, pinning, covering with soil | Avoid wrinkles and tears                   |
| Carbon Composites       | Epoxy bonding, laminating, wrapping | Surface must be clean and dry              |

## 3.8 Site Observations / Practical Insight

* **Paints:** Observe uniform coverage, avoid peeling or bubbling
* **Bitumen:** Check for correct temperature and compaction in road layers
* **Waterproofing:** Inspect for joint sealing, membrane continuity
* **Geotextiles:** Ensure no folding or soil intrusion
* **Carbon Composites:** Verify bonding quality and surface preparation
