# **Waterproofing Materials**

## **1. Introduction**

**Waterproofing** refers to the process of making a structure **impervious to the ingress of water** under hydrostatic pressure or moisture intrusion.
Effective waterproofing enhances **durability, service life, and hygiene** of buildings, especially in foundations, basements, roofs, and water-retaining structures.

The materials used must form a **continuous, durable, and elastic barrier** against water penetration without compromising the structural performance.

## **2. Functions and Importance**

* **Prevents leakage** in basements, terraces, water tanks, and bathrooms.
* **Protects reinforcement** from corrosion due to moisture exposure.
* **Improves durability** of concrete and masonry by preventing dampness.
* **Reduces maintenance costs** and enhances building aesthetics.
* **Ensures comfort** by maintaining indoor humidity and temperature levels.
