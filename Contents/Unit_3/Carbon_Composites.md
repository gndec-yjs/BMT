# **Carbon Composites**

## **1. Introduction**

**Carbon composites**, also known as **carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP)**, are **advanced composite materials** consisting of **carbon fibers embedded in a polymer matrix** such as **epoxy, polyester, or vinyl ester resin**.
They combine **exceptionally high strength and stiffness** with **low weight**, making them ideal for strengthening and retrofitting civil engineering structures.

In civil applications, carbon composites are primarily used for:

* **Structural strengthening and rehabilitation** of existing RC members.
* **Corrosion-resistant reinforcements** in aggressive environments.
* **Lightweight and durable structural components.**
