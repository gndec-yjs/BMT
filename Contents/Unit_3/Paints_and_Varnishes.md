# **Paints and Varnishes**

## **1. Introduction**

Paints and varnishes are **surface finishing materials** used in building construction to enhance **aesthetic appeal**, provide **protection against environmental effects**, and improve **durability**. These materials form a thin film over surfaces to prevent deterioration due to **moisture, sunlight, temperature variation, chemical attack**, and **mechanical wear**.

## **2. Paints**

### **2.1 Definition**

A *paint* is a **pigmented liquid or semi-liquid material** that, when applied to a surface in a thin layer, forms an **opaque solid film** upon drying. It is used to protect or decorate substrates such as masonry, wood, steel, or plastered surfaces.
