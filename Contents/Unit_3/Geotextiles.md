# **Geotextiles**

## **1. Introduction**

**Geotextiles** are **permeable fabrics** made from synthetic or natural fibers used in civil engineering applications to **improve soil behavior**, provide **separation**, **filtration**, **drainage**, **reinforcement**, and **protection**.
They are part of the broader family of **geosynthetics**, which also includes geomembranes, geogrids, geonets, and geocomposites.

Commonly used polymers:

* **Polypropylene (PP)**
* **Polyester (PET)**
* **Polyethylene (PE)**
* **Polyamide (Nylon)**

## **5. Mechanisms of Action**

### **5.1 Separation**

* Geotextile acts as a **barrier** between two dissimilar materials (e.g., soft subgrade and granular base).
* Prevents **intermixing**, ensuring stability and load distribution.
* Common in **pavement layers**, **railway tracks**, and **embankments**.

### **5.2 Filtration**

* Allows water to flow **perpendicular** to the fabric while retaining soil particles.
* Maintains **hydraulic continuity** without soil loss.
* Used in **drainage systems**, **riverbanks**, and **retaining walls**.

### **5.3 Drainage**

* Permits **lateral flow** of water **within** the fabric plane.
* Used for **subsurface drainage**, **landfills**, and **backfills**.

### **5.4 Reinforcement**

* Provides **tensile resistance** to soils lacking strength.
* Mobilizes **tensile forces** to distribute loads over a wider area.
* Used in **steep slopes**, **retaining walls**, and **embankments on soft soils**.

### **5.5 Protection**

* Serves as a **cushion** or **separator layer** to prevent puncture or abrasion of waterproof membranes or geomembranes.

## **7. Design Considerations**

* **Permeability ratio (kf/ks):**
  The geotextile permeability ( k_f ) must be greater than the soil permeability ( k_s ) to prevent clogging.

* **Retention criteria:**
  The apparent opening size (AOS or O95) should be small enough to retain soil but large enough to allow drainage.

* **Strength criteria:**
  Based on tensile strength, puncture resistance, and seam strength depending on loading and installation conditions.

* **Durability:**
  Must resist degradation due to **UV radiation**, **chemicals**, **biological activity**, and **installation damage**.

## **8. Installation Practices**

1. **Surface Preparation**

   * Level and compact subgrade.
   * Remove sharp objects or debris.

2. **Laying of Geotextile**

   * Unroll fabric smoothly without wrinkles.
   * Overlap joints typically **300–450 mm**, depending on site conditions.

3. **Anchoring and Joining**

   * Use pins, adhesives, or heat welding for joining.
   * Overlaps secured to prevent displacement during filling.

4. **Placement of Fill Material**

   * Spread fill in thin layers to avoid tearing.
   * Avoid direct contact of heavy equipment with geotextile.

5. **Inspection and Quality Control**

   * Check for tears, overlaps, and alignment before covering.
